# multi-class-image-classification-with-a-convolutional-neural-network
Multi-class image classification with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

# About the project
Multi-class image classification with a CNN using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
This is a Google Colab notebook to classify images across multiple categories of vehicles and animals, such aeroplanes, automibiles, birds, and cats, from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The data is first preprocessed and a simple CNN is used to implement the model for the multi-class classification of images. The model performs fairly well and achieves an accuracy of about 71%.

# Tools Used
Tools and libraries used in this project include TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, scikit-learn, and seaborn.

# Who can benefit from the project?
Anyone can use the project to get started with the basics of multi-class classification using image data and TensorFlow.

# Getting Started
Anyone interested in getting started with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Computer Vision, particularly, image classification or multi-class image classification using TensorFlow and neural networks - specifically, CNNs, can clone or download the project to get started.
